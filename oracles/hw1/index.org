** Problem 15 [FOR GRADE]
   We can see that the direction field results in constant rate of change of
   zero at level where $y=0$ and $y=3$. Then we can also see that the direction
   of the graph decreases when $y<0$ and $y>3$, while also increasing in section
   of $y>0$ and $y<3$. That means, we are looking for a separate $y$ to get
   constant change at $0$ and $(3-y)$ term, so that the constraints above are
   satisfied. $\therefore y' = y(3-y)$. Answer is =h=.

** Problem 7 [FOR GRADE]
   Our differential equation is as given
   \begin{equation*}
           \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{p}{2} - 450
   \end{equation*}

   *a*. Find the time at which the population becomes extinct if $p(0)=850$

   We find that $\mu(t) = e^{\int -\frac{1}{2} dt} = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}$. Then

   \begin{align*}
           \frac{d}{dt}(\mu(t)p) = -450 \mu(t)                                                 \\
           \implies p(t) & = \frac{\int -450\mu(t) dt}{\mu(t)}                                 \\
                         & = \frac{\int -450 e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}dt}{e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}}         \\
                         & = \frac{-450 \times (-2e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}) + C}{e^{-\frac{1}{2}t}} \\
                         & = 900 + C e^{\frac{1}{2}t}
   \end{align*}

   Then by using $p(0)=850$, we find the constant $C$ to be $-50$. We need to
   find the time $t_e$, at which $p(t_e)=0$. We simply solve the equation
   $0 = 900 - 50 e^{\frac{1}{2}t_e}$, where we find $t_e = \ln(324) \approx 5.78$. 
   
   *b.* Find the time of extinction if $p(0)=p_0$, where $0<p_0<900$

   Using the above, we find that $t_e = 2 \ln(\frac{900}{900-p_0})$

   *c.* Find the initial population $p_0$ if the population is to become extinct in
   1 year.

   Recall from Example 1 that $t$ is measured in months. So we simply solve
   \begin{equation*}
           0 = 900 - (900-p_0)e^{6} \implies p_0 = 900 - \frac{900}{e^6} \approx 897.77
   \end{equation*}
** Problem 9
   *a.* If the limiting velocity is 49m/s (the same as in Example 2), show that
    the equation of motion can be written as
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{1}{245}(49^2-v^2)
    \end{equation*}

    Recall the base equation from Example 2, by using the given, we have
    \begin{equation*}
      0 = 9.8 - C (49^2) \implies C = \frac{9.8}{49^2} = \frac{1}{245}\\
      \implies \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{1}{245}(49^2-v^2)
    \end{equation*}

    *b.* If $v(0) = 0$, find an expression for $v(t)$ at any time.

    We can view this problem as a first-order separable equation and rewrite it
    as
    \begin{equation*}
            \int{\frac{dv}{49^2-v^2}} = \int{\frac{dt}{245}}
    \end{equation*}
    After some computations, the expression for $v(t)$ is
    $49\tanh(\frac{t}{5})$

    *c.* Plot your solution from part b and the solution (26) from Example 2 on
    the same axes.

    *d.* Based on your plots in part *c*, compare the effect of a quadratic drag
    force with that of a linear drag force. 

    The quadratic drag damps the speed faster and has a bigger effect on the
    speed than the linear dependance.

    *e.* Find the distance $x(t)$ that the object falls in time $t$.

    We know that $\frac{dx}{dt} = v(t) = 49\tanh(\frac{t}{5})$ so then
    $x(t) = 245\ln(\cosh(\frac{t}{5})) + C$. If $x(0) = 0$, then $C = 0$.

    *f.* Find the time $T$ it takes the object to fall 300m.

    Simply solve $300 = 245 \ln(\cosh(\frac{t}{5}))$, it will be something like
        $t = 5\cosh^{-1}(e^{\frac{60}{49}}) \approx 9.477$
